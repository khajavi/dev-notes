# Apache Spark
Spark is as a VERY fast in-memory, data-processing framework – like lightning fast. 100x faster than Hadoop fast.

* fast interactive queries
* streaming analytics
* graph analytics
* machine learning

Spark was developed in 2009 at UC Berkeley AMPLab, open sourced in 2010, and became a top-level Apache project in February, 2014. It has since become  one of the largest open source communities in big data, with over 200 contributors in 50+ organizations
